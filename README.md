# RandomRaters
Assign to 3 raters each a random list of StudyIDs based on a large list of unknown size. 

Each list should be unique and not repeat any StudyIDs.

# What I Learned
* random.choice() function to randomly choose an ID
* Continue to randomly assign IDs till the end of the file even if the number of IDs in each list is uneven.
* Make sure that an ID is unique across all lists even if the ID is repeated in the original list
* Practice using both csv and pandas modules
